# Pin-Generator
Generate pin from random numbers
This code enables the user to generate different numbers that can be used as a pin for security.
It uses the random number function to print out various random numbers that can be used as pin
This code allows the user to input how many digits they want the code to be, however, they are not allowed to use more than 8 digits or less than 4 digits so the user does not forget the code if its too long or the code is not easy to crack if its too short.
This code was designed in python using the random function.
Anyone can run the code using Visual Studio Code and Python directly.
